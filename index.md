# Welcome to the GitHub Page of RUNNER

This app was made for the Athletics Running training of my daughter.

## START - STOP - RESET
Pressing the START button will start a "On your marks.....get set" audio file.
The gunshot will be heared and time will start running.
Pressing the >>STOP<<  button within 1 second will give another shotgun sound for "false start".
After 1 second a normal STOP of the run can be pressed. The time is indicated in HH:MM:SS.mmm
HH: Hours
MM: Minutes
SS: Seconds
mmmm : mircroseconds.

### Finetuning your smartphone.
The reaction speed of your smartphone in playing the sound and starting the timer can differ. Adjust the "Delay ShotGun->Timer(ms) slider to adjust for accuracy.

## [ ] Off    [ ] On
The button/bar just below the timer is a button for AUTO-play. Easy for training indoor on the 50m-60m.
Default set to 20seconds. Adjust to your liking.
After pressing this button the sequence will repeat on your set "Dealy Auto-Rerun(s)"time . From shot to shot it will take 2x the set time.

## LAP MARK
While the time is progressing you can choose to press LAP or MARK to have lap time ( after every lap , laptime is initialised ) or marked .

# PWA
This app is intended to be run as PWA. The current ( beta test ) is not yet hosted on https. This will prevent certain options.
When opened in CHrome ( Android ) or Safari (iOS ) you can choose to add to Homescreen / Add to Startscreen.
This will give an "app" icon to your homescreen. Fullscreen experience.
In Android the Fullscreen text on the buttom can be used also.
